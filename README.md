# Loan_Approval_Prediction
This project explores the efficiency of machine learning models like Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) Classifier, Decision Tree, and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), in real-world applications such as predicting loan approvals. The dataset utilized is small and accessible on Kaggle. The Python notebook includes straightforward code covering conventional machine learning model development steps, including data preprocessing and manipulation using Pandas and NumPy, data visualization with Matplotlib, and implementation of classifiers via the scikit-learn library.


The primary objective is to showcase the seamless integration of machine learning models into a web interface using the Streamlit framework. The app.py file encapsulates the code responsible for creating the simple yet interactive website interface.
